# BitLocker Nightmare:

In the light recent events of a **VBS ransomware attack** that abuses bitlocker to encrypt all data on the harddrive. i have created this **custom script to disable WScript.exe and CScript.exe** to prevent the host machine from running any VBA or VBS Scripts.

**use the disable_wscript.cmd to disable the windows script host and use the enable_wscript.cmd to enable it** 
 Disabling Bitlocker is also highly recomended if possible.

## Note:
This script requires admin privileges to run as it edits the registry.
